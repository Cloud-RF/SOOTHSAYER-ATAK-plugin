- **Search-Aware**: Works with filtered lists and respects current search queries

### 5. **Automated Tracking & Updates**
- **Time-Based Updates**: Configurable interval-based recalculation (default: 5 minutes)
- **Distance-Based Updates**: Movement threshold triggers (configurable in meters)
- **Real-time Position Sync**: Automatically updates lat/lon coordinates as markers move
- **Fixed Height Operations**: Standardized 2m antenna height for consistent ground operations
- **Intelligent Initialization**: Proper baseline position tracking for accurate distance calculations

### 6. **Template Management**
- **Persistent Template Selection**: Radio templates saved per marker across sessions
- **Dropdown Integration**: Reuses existing template spinner styling and functionality
- **Bulk Configuration**: Configure multiple markers simultaneously
- **Template Validation**: Only valid templates with proper data are selectable

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Data Persistence
- **Checkbox States**: Stored in preferences as JSON (`co_opt_checkbox_selections`)
- **Template Selections**: Stored in preferences as JSON (`co_opt_radio_selections`)
- **Session Recovery**: Automatically restores previous configurations on dialog open

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Marker Collection**: Recursive map traversal with smart filtering
- **Lazy Loading**: Template adapters created on-demand
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of tracking handlers and listeners

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Compact UI Design**: Reduced padding and optimized layout for tactical environments
- **Fast Animations**: 0.8-second flash duration for quick tactical feedback
- **Centered Text**: Professional appearance with centered callsign display
- **No Toast Spam**: Reduced unnecessary notifications for cleaner operation

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### Time-Based Tracking
- **Refresh Interval**: Configurable seconds between automatic updates
- **Countdown Display**: Real-time countdown showing next update time
- **Manual Override**: Stop button to disable tracking when needed

### Distance-Based Tracking
- **Movement Threshold**: Configurable meters before triggering recalculation
- **Position Baseline**: Proper initialization of starting positions
- **Smart Detection**: Only recalculates when actual movement exceeds threshold

## üìã Operational Workflow

1. **Open Co-Opt Dialog**: Click the Co-Opt button from main interface
2. **Browse Available Markers**: View organized list of contacts and CoT markers
3. **Search & Filter**: Use search bar to quickly find specific markers
4. **Select Markers**: Check boxes for markers to include in analysis
5. **Assign Templates**: Select appropriate radio templates from dropdowns
6. **Configure Tracking**: Set time and/or distance-based update preferences
7. **Activate**: Click OK to begin real-time tracking and analysis
8. **Monitor**: Watch countdown timer and automatic recalculations
9. **Manage**: Checked markers stay at top for easy access and modification
