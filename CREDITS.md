## Critics

Publishing disruptive open source software within a market where everything is reassuringly expensive is a sure way to upset greedy and jealous little men. 

This low value plugin code is of variable quality (we don't even like Java), so our critics aren't entirely wrong....but the API that powers this, and other software plugins, is the key capability and this took over 12 years to perfect.

Do the taxpayer a favour, check your ego, and **fork this project**. We've even put an MIT license on it to help you do that privately and legally so you can get the shiny new capability *and* claim the credit.
