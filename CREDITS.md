## Critics

Publishing disruptive open source software within a market where everything is reassuringly expensive has put us at odds with little men who crave money and we're ok with that. 

This plugin code is of variable quality, overdue a refactor and (shock horror) supports self-signed SSL certificates....but the API that powers this, and other client plugins, is the key capability and this took over 12 years to perfect. If you'd like to see that code, come to our office.

We've chosen an MIT license to help people who can't collaborate, for good reasons sometimes, exploit this capability to it's maximum potential.
